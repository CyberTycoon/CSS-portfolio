        <img class="pictures" src="./coffee images/colombian roast.png" alt="colombian roast">
        <p style="width: 100%;"><h4>Colombian roast coffee is celebrated worldwide for its exceptional quality,
            characterized by a well-balanced taste with hints of caramel and nutty 
            undertones. Grown primarily in regions like Huila and Antioquia, Colombian 
            coffee benefits from the country's ideal climate and meticulous processing 
            techniques. The traditional "wet processing" method preserves the beans'
             flavors, while sustainable farming practices ensure long-term viability. 
             Beyond its superior taste, Colombian coffee is deeply ingrained in the
              country's culture, symbolizing hospitality and camaraderie. Its versatility
               makes it suitable for various brewing methods, appealing to both casual
                drinkers and connoisseurs alike. Overall, Colombian roast coffee is a 
                testament to Colombia's dedication to excellence in coffee production 
                and remains a beloved favorite worldwide.</h4></p>

                <p style="width: 100%;"><h4>French roast coffee is a darkly roasted coffee originating from 
                    France, known for its rich flavor, bold taste, and intense aroma. 
                    It is roasted at high temperatures, resulting in a deep brown to
                     nearly black color and a shiny surface. This roast level offers a 
                     bittersweet flavor profile with smoky undertones and low acidity.
                      While some appreciate its robustness, others argue that it may mask
                       the unique characteristics of the beans. Despite controversies,
                        French roast coffee remains popular among enthusiasts who enjoy 
                        its powerful flavor and invigorating aroma.</h4></p>
